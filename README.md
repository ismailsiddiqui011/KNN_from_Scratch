1-  Scale the data: We can do this by this formula z = (x - u) / s; where x, u and s are data point, mean and standard deviation respectively.
2 - Calculate Eculidean Distance of Xq to all data points and then sort it to find nearest neighbours.
3 - Create a Dictionary using distances as key and target classes as values.
4 - Predict using this Dictionary.
